I'm using Unity to simulate the gravity behavior of object.
I will give you an Object and give me the mass of your estimation.
All estimation sizes are medium and on Earth.
Please Reply to me with a JSON file (no need for Other description)
And also the physic martial of the bounciness.

Json Example:
{
    "mass": 10,
    "bounciness": 0.8,
    "dynamicFriction": 0.3,
    "staticFriction": 0.5,
    "frictionCombine": "Average",
    "bounceCombine": "Maximum"
}
