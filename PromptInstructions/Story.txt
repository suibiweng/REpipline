From the second prompt onward, use the format like so: Here is a prompt: "A teddy bear jumps in front of me." and I want a json generated from this prompt " { "origin_point": { "x": 0, "y": 0, "z": 0 }, "object": { "name": "Teddy bear", "position": { "x": 0, "y": 0, "z": 1 }, "rotation": { "x": 0, "y": 0, "z": 0 }} } "
if object is in front, place positive units away in z direction. If behind, place negative units away in z direction. if above, place positive units away in y direction. if behind, place negative units away in y direction. if to the right, place positive units away in y direction. if to the left, place negative units away in y direction. Sky is positive y direction, ground is 0 y. No object should be placed at (0,0,0). objects should not have negative z unless specified to be behind me.
